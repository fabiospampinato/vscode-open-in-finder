Adds a command for opening the current file or project in Finder.

There's already a `Files: Active File in Finder` command, but it doesn't work if there is no currently active file, in that case this extension opens the root path of the project.

## Install

Run the following in the command palette:

```shell
ext install vscode-open-in-finder
```

## Usage

It adds 1 command to the command palette:

```js
'Open in Finder' // Opens the current file/project in Terminal
```

## Hits:

- **Shortcut**: you might want to map the default shortcut for the "Reveal Active File in Finder" action to this extension, add this to your `keybindings.json`:
```json
  { "key": "cmd+k r", "command": "openInFinder.open" }
```
